                <p>Hellllloooo!</p>

                <p>First of all, I want to greet you a HAPPY NEW YEAR. Siguro ma rereceive mo ito exactly at 12 am.<br>
                    Matagal an actually itong sulat na 'to, siguro 2 weeks old na rin.
                    Uunahan ko na agad ng isang pang malakasang paghinge ng pasensya kasi sabi ko di na ako magre-reach
                    out ever again but here I am, still reaching out for the nth time!</p>

                <p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately, and I really needed to say this, not to pull you back in or awayin ka, but to
                    finally let go of the ghosts that have been haunting me.<br>
                    First, thank you for being part of my 2025. Even with everything that happened, you were one of the
                    brightest parts of this year for me, and I’ll always be grateful for that.</p>

                <p>I know meeting me and being with me drained you completely. I drained the
                    life out of you, tormented every piece of your heart, and left you exhausted in ways I didn't fully
                    understand back then. I'm truly sorry for that. I also know now that I took so many things for
                    granted, your patience, your effort, your presence, and the way you kept choosing me even when I
                    made it hard. I didn't protect what I had with you the way I should have, and you didn't deserve any
                    of that.</p>

                <p>But I also want to thank you for the good you gave me. When we were together, you made me feel
                    confident in myself in a way I hadn't before. You gave me the best push I needed, the kind that
                    helped me grow, even if I didn't show it at the time. You believed in me when I struggled to believe
                    in myself, and that meant everything.</p>

                <p>I want you to know that everything I showed you back then was real. Even when I was angry, even when
                    I was overwhelmed, my empathy, my concern, and most of all my love for you were genuine. None of it
                    was fake or convenient. I meant every word I said, and I felt every emotion deeply, even when I
                    didn't express it in the healthiest way.</p>

                <p>When you left, I was desperate for closure. I kept going crazy thinking about all the "what ifs" and
                    "whys," replaying everything in my head. Why couldn't you fight for us a little more? Why couldn't
                    you wait for the parts of me that were still trying to bloom? But I know you had choices. You had to
                    do what was better for you, and I understand that now.</p>

                <p>On my side, it all felt blurry and confusing. But now I realize the closure I was looking for has
                    been right in front of me this whole time. The way I suffered after you left showed me just how
                    deeply I had hurt you. My pain was the proof of how much I drained you.</p>

                <p>Since you left, a part of me has felt like I don't even have the right to heal, to be sad, to mourn,
                    or even to feel happy again. I've carried this guilt that says I don't deserve those things because
                    of what I put you through. And honestly, I've felt that way until today.</p>

                <p>I know I don't really have the right to keep asking how you are after fumbling things between us so
                    badly. I know that every time I reach out, it might feel confusing or unnecessary. But whenever I
                    ask, it has never come from entitlement or expectation. It comes from care. Even now, I still
                    genuinely hope you are okay, and that feeling never really left.</p>

                <p>I never really understood how people can just cut someone out of their life completely. The thought
                    of forgetting someone who meant so much honestly scares me. It feels <br>
                    impossible and terrifying (Pero, sa akin lang naman 'yannn). But
                    I know that's what you needed, that's what I needed, and I respect that. </p>

                <p>Since you left, I've held on for so long, clinging to the pain and the memories. But maybe finally
                    letting go is what will make everything clear, for both of us.</p>

                <p>More than anything, I wish I could see you one last time, just sit across from you, look you in the
                    eyes, and say all of this to your face. God knows how much I crave that kind of real, physical
                    closeness and conversation. Words on a screen feel so small compared to being in the same room,
                    feeling the weight of everything unsaid finally lift. I'd give anything for that moment, to hear
                    your voice and let you see that I truly mean every word. But I know that's probably not possible,
                    and I'm okay with that now.</p>

                <p>I just needed to say this out loud, to you, so I can finally release these ghosts and move forward. I
                    wish you nothing but peace, happiness, and all the good things you deserve.</p>
                <p>As the year turns, I hope you carry forward the moments that made you stronger <br>
                    and gently release the ones that weighed you down. <br>
                    May this New Year meet you with softer mornings, kinder days, and the quiet <br>
                    confidence that you are becoming someone you once needed. <br>
                    Whatever you’re hoping for peace, healing, love, or courage. I hope it finds <br>
                    its way to you in its own time. Here’s to new beginnings, small joys, and a year <br>
                    that treats your heart with care. Happy New Year!.

                <p>Take care, Mj! Maraming maraming salamattttt.</p>

                <p class="poem">"Yet if you should forget me for a while<br>
                    And afterwards remember, do not grieve:<br>
                    For if the darkness and corruption leave<br>
                    A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,<br>
                    Better by far you should forget and smile<br>
                    Than that you should remember and be sad"<br>
